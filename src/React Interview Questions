React is a javascipt library that has what is known as a virtual DOM which handles  processes for a single page application(SPA).  A representation of the DOM objects.  A light-weight copy.

React uses JSX to create components with one-way data binding.  It is simple javascript code that provides great performance.

React boosts productivity.  React renders faster.  The equates to performance via stable code that is SEO friendly.  React has tool sets and even has React-Native which is for mobile apps.

Whereas Angular is a complete framework, React is a javascript library.
Angular is two-way data binding and React is only one.

Render in react is when a component calls a function which returns a React element instead.

State is where property values are stored.  When the state changes the element re-renders.

Props are HTML attributes that are used as arguements.

setState command is used to update a components state.

This would be a stateful component as opposed to a stateless component just displays prop values.

There are three phases in React.  Mounting, Unmounting and Changing or "Updating" when the state changes.
